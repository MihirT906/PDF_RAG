The chatbot interacts with complex documents like flight regulations, reports, and CRM user guides, making it easier to retrieve specific information and verify decisions. As a demonstration, I trained the chatbot to understand DGCA's civil aviation requirements on 'FLIGHT CREW STANDARDS TRAINING & LICENSING'. Now, users can ask it questions such as:
"The time difference between Singapore and India is 2 and a half hours. If a crew member flies from India to Singapore, do they need to be acclimatized?"
"Can you show all rules that are related to consecutive nights?"
"Is it okay for a crew member to fly 80 hours in a 14-day consecutive window?"
These queries can be answered quickly and accurately without manually going through the entire document. You can test out this prototype by navigating to https://flight-reg-assistant.streamlit.app.
